# nvim-config

My current nvim config. Inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/tree/master).  

Should be cross-platform between windows and linux.

As easy as cloning this repo into:
- **Windows:** `cd %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local && git clone https://github.com/serchugar/nvim-config nvim`
- **Linux:** `cd ~/.config && git clone https://github.com/serchugar/nvim-config nvim`

After that just delete the .git folder within the new nvim directory.
